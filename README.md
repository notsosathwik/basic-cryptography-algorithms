# basic-cryptography-algorithms
This repo consists of a few basic cryptography algorithms with their JAVA implementations to encrypt and decrypt messages.

List of Ciphers:
1. Affine Cipher
2. Auto Key Cipher
3. Caesar Cipher
4. ElGamal Cryptosystem
5. Hill Cipher
6. Multiplicative Cipher
7. One-Time Pad Cipher
8. Playfair Cipher
9. Rabin Cryptosystem
10. RSA Cryptosystem
11. Vigenere Cipher

Along with these ciphers, this repo contains a few basic implementations of the following:
1. Chinese Remainder Theorem
2. Fermat's Little Theorem
3. Finding GCD using Euclidean Algorithm
4. Finding Inverse Modulo using Extended Euclidean Algorithm
5. Basic Miller Rabin's Primality Test
6. Basic Modular Arithmetic Calculator

Every implementation is completely basic. These are not at all meant for encrypting serious data (As if anyone's gonna use this shit).

Note: There are no errors in these codes but exceptions might occur. So, when prompted for a String(Integer) input only String(Integer) since I did not put any try and catch statements anywhere in the code. If you want to, you are more than welcome to do that.
